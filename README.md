# 100 Days of Machine Learning

This repository contains my implementation of the **100 Days of Machine Learning** challenge, inspired by CampusX. It includes daily Jupyter notebooks, mini-projects, and scanned notes from the course. The goal is to build a strong foundation in ML, covering everything from Python basics and statistics to deep learning and deployment. All notes and exercises are based on CampusX's structured curriculum to help reinforce key ML concepts through consistent practice.
